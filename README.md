# On Board!

### Hello :smiley: This an app with Spring Boot, JavaFX, CSS styling, and Maven for Package Manager.

The basic concept is to search for Jobs (with Adzuna API), and record your applications and application status. Then you can analyze your data with different statistics and insights (i.e. application-to-interview rate, interview-to-acceptance rate, num of applications, which companies/areas are most likely to respond to your applications?, comparing resume and job description similiarity, etc.)

**Additional Features:**
- Save to Favories
- Apply in App (with WebViewer) or open in Browser
- Export everything to CSV
- Spell Checker/Correcter

**Future Implementations:**
- Google Chrome Extension (track applications and add to db, very simple)
- DB integration instead of CSV for companies and users
- Dedicated Python serverport for custom API calls and data analysis
- More robust way to search jobs
